Running this code
=================

This project has the geohash-java project as a submodule and needs input data.

To run any of this you need to do the following things:

*	Acquire the places2k.txt file from here (it's pretty large so I don't version it): http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/places2k.html
*	run `git submodule init && git submodule update`
*	run `ant test`

This will run all the unit tests for the geohash library that depend on the census file(s).

Continuous Integration
